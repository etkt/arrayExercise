# arrayExercise
## Project:
An exercise based on Zell's Learn JS
section 4 lesson 2

The idea is to show the starting array in column one, a list of methods to perform on the array in column two, and the output of each method in column three. All methods are performed on the original array.
Then i wanted to show the code used below the columns.
*ALL* feedback appreciated


arrayExercise.js shows the full assignment with my solutions. It is heavily commented for my benefit.

lesson.js is my attempt to visualize the methods in the browser.
